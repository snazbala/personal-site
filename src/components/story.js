            <p className="first-paragraph">
                I have a degree in International Studies. When graduating
                college, I imagined myself soon working in the field and saving
                the world day to day. I packed up, left the city I’d loved for
                the last 3.5 years, my long term relationship, and everything
                I’d known on the West coast. I traded it all in for a short
                stint in Washington DC at a nonprofit organization working in
                the legal field to represent minority lawyers. But I soon
                realized that I didn’t see a future in this career path --
                finally being around lawyers every day, I knew I didn’t want to
                pursue a career in law or politics. I also wasn’t learning
                anything in my job. Studying history, politics, foreign policy,
                and the complex relationships between states was completely
                different than what I was doing in my day to day at the
                nonprofit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I decided to pack up and come back to San Francisco. With few
                job prospects offered to me with my International Studies degree
                in hand, I took a job at Eventbrite, where my now-husband was
                then interning. The role? The lowest level at the company,
                Customer Support Representative. My job was to answer phone
                calls, respond to emails, and assist our customers with the
                Eventbrite commitment to service. But I quickly excelled,
                resolving more than 100 phone and email cases per day. I found
                new ways to help our customers, and I started getting involved
                with the more advanced cases dealing with bug reports. I also
                started developing leadership and training skills through
                leading the onboarding of 40 temporary hires and then later
                working in a small team to onboard 3 separate classes of new
                full time hires to open our brand new Nashville office.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was then faced with two career paths: leadership and technical
                development. I loved each for different reasons and had spent a
                considerable amount of my own spare time developing skills in
                each, but I felt a bigger opportunity awaited me with the
                technical side. I ended up applying for Hackbright Academy,
                which is a short intensive engineering bootcamp for women in San
                Francisco, to see if I could make it as a software engineer. I
                made it to the last interview round and I was sure that I would
                be accepted, but I faced rejection at the last minute. It was
                devastating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it was the best thing that could have happened to me.
                Less than a month after facing that rejection, my colleagues in
                engineering took notice of my technical prowess, and Eventbrite
                offered me a position of Quality Assurance Engineer. I was being
                given an engineering position despite my lack of a formal
                technical degree or training. Eventbrite believed in me and my
                abilities so much that they were willing to pay me to learn on
                the job, rather than me having to spend thousands through a
                bootcamp program.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my new role, I was a sponge, absorbing the new knowledge
                and skills, diving into programming with my new teams, all while
                still giving back to the engineering team with my customer
                perspective and empathy. I ended up transforming the way we
                thought about quality, and as a senior member of the team and
                later as the QA Manager, I transitioned the company from using
                our QA engineers for manual QA only to a new Quality Driven
                Development design with QA at the forefront of building high
                quality features.
            </p>
            <p>
                That all ended in October of 2017. More than five years of
                customer service and quality assurance positions had given me a
                deep wealth of customer empathy, leadership skills, and a broad
                spectrum of technical abilities. With a reorganization in the
                company happening at the same time, the timing suddenly was
                right for me to get back to what I had given up so long ago --
                the chance to be a software engineer
            </p>
            <p>
                So that brings us to now. I’m currently a software engineer on
                the Expand Checkout squad at Eventbrite, working in our frontend
                in React and Redux, and continuing to build on my previous
                knowledge in Python (learned on the job through my QA role).
            </p>
            <p className="last-paragraph">
                It’s been thrilling so far, and I’m incredibly grateful every
                day that I’ve been given these incredible opportunities, and for
                the people who have mentored and inspired me along the way.
