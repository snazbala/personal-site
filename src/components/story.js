                I have a degree in International Studies. When graduating
                college, I imagined myself soon working in the field and saving
                the world day to day. I packed up, left the city I’d loved for
                the last 3.5 years, my long term relationship, and everything
                I’d known on the West coast. I traded it all in for a short
                stint in Washington DC at a nonprofit organization working in
                the legal field to represent minority lawyers. But I soon
                realized that I didn’t see a future in this career path.
                Studying history, politics, foreign policy, and the complex
                relationships between states was completely different than what
                I was doing in my day to day at the nonprofit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I decided to pack up and come back to San Francisco. With few
                job prospects offered to me with my International Studies degree
                in hand, I took a job at Eventbrite, where my now-husband was
                then interning. The role? The lowest level at the company,
                Customer Support Representative. My job was to answer phone
                calls, respond to emails, and assist our customers with the
                Eventbrite commitment to service. But I quickly excelled,
                resolving more than 100 phone and email cases per day. I found
                new ways to help our customers, and I started getting involved
                with the more advanced cases dealing with bug reports, helping
                our triage team with reproducing technical issues so that our
                engineering team could begin work on fixes. I also started
                developing leadership and training skills through leading the
                onboarding of 40 temporary hires and then later working in a
                small team to onboard 3 separate classes of new full time hires
                to open our brand new Nashville office.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was then faced with two career paths: leadership and technical
                development. I loved each for different reasons and had spent a
                considerable amount of my own spare time developing skills in
                each, but I felt a bigger opportunity awaited me with the
                technical side. I had a desire to become a software engineer,
                but I wasn't sure the timing was right for me to go back to
                school.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, I had also devoted time to building
                relationships in our engineering team. Not too long after, my
                colleagues in engineering took notice of my technical prowess,
                and Eventbrite offered me a position of Quality Assurance
                Engineer. I was being given an engineering position despite my
                lack of a formal technical degree or training. Eventbrite
                believed in me and my abilities so much that they were willing
                to pay me to learn on the job, rather than me having to spend
                thousands to go back to school or to go through a bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my new role, I was a sponge, absorbing the new knowledge
                and skills, diving into programming with my new teams, all while
                still contributing to the engineering team with my customer
                perspective and empathy. I ended up transforming the way we
                thought about quality, and as a senior member of the team and
                later as the QA Manager, I transitioned the company from using
                our QA engineers for manual QA only to a new Quality Driven
                Development design with QA at the forefront of building high
                quality features.
            </p>
            <p>
                That all ended in October of 2017. More than five years of
                customer service and quality assurance positions had given me a
                deep wealth of customer empathy, leadership skills, and a broad
                spectrum of technical abilities. With a reorganization in the
                company happening at the same time, the timing suddenly was
                right for me to get back to what I had set aside so long ago --
                the chance to be a software engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I jumped into a full time software engineer role on
                the Expand Checkout squad at Eventbrite, specializing in the
                frontend in React and Redux, and continuing to build on my
                previous knowledge in Python (learned on the job through my QA
                role).
            </p>
            <p>
                Most recently, I moved to Seattle, WA, where I'm a software engineer
                at Convoy, a digital freight marketplace whose mission is to transport the
                world’s goods with endless capacity and zero waste. My team works on building
                new tools and automating workflows for our Operations teams who ensure that
                our freight gets to where it needs to be in the most efficient and effective way,
                while delivering high quality service.
            </p>
            <p className="last-paragraph">
                It’s been thrilling so far, and I’m incredibly grateful every
                day that I’ve been given these incredible opportunities, and for
                the people who have mentored and inspired me along the way.
